Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Zoho CRM customization and integrations
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on youth coding resources (how do we help kids learn the joy of programming?)
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with local (KY, USA) and remote-friendly **junior developer jobs, with great mentorship**
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Aquinas, bicycles, vegetable gardening, or Jekyll / JAMstack
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: learn@awesomeinc.org
